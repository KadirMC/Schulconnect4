# CONNECT 4

_CONNECT 4_ is a website hosting a game called [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)*. The site will be targeted towards people who want to play a quick and fun game regardless of their age. The site can be used for adults to have a short getaway and for children to learn the rules. The main goal of this project is to implement my JavaScript knowledge in a real-world context.

*Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game, in which players take turns to drop their coloured disc into a 6-row by 7-column grid until one of the players forms a line of 4 discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
