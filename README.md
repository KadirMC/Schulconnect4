# CONNECT 4

_CONNECT 4_ is a website hosting a game called [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)*. The site will be targeted towards people who want to play a quick and fun game regardless of their age. The site can be used for adults to have a short getaway and for children to learn the rules. The main goal of this project is to implement my JavaScript knowledge in a real-world context.

*Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game, in which players take turns to drop their coloured disc into a 6-row by 7-column grid until one of the players forms a line of 4 discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## Design

- Colour Scheme

  The best-known version of the physical game set which has been produced by [Hasbro](https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/connect-4-game:80FB5BCA-5056-9047-F5F4-5EB5DF88DAF4) uses 3 colours: blue for the grid, yellow and red for discs. I have followed this colour convention with my own interpretation using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) > Create a design > Logo > Styles and the colour picker.

- Typography

  - Headings: [Fredoka One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One) is used with Cursive as the fallback font in case the font isnâ€™t being imported into the site correctly. I have chosen Fredoka One for its big, bold and rounded shape which gives a soft feeling and adds a little fun to headings.

  - Paragraph: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) is used with Sans Serif as the fallback font. I have chosen Poppins for readability and its sharp corners as opposed to Fredoka One.

- Logo

  The logo has the website name _CONNECT 4_ with the number 4 in a yellow colour on a red background circle which are the main colours of the game.

## Wireframes / Mockups

- _CONNECT 4_ is designed with the following goals in mind:
	- A user can navigate to other sections while playing a game and resume the game without having to restart.
	- A user can start a game with as few clicks as possible.
- To achieve these goals:
	- It is designed as a one-page website.
	- One section is shown at a time. Others are hidden to the user.
	- The Settings section is on the landing screen.
- I created wireframes and mockups for mobile and desktop.
